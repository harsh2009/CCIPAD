        <p> <strong> By Fr. Ikechukwu Odigbo</strong></p>

        <p>This article is a follow-up to my last article on the fate of the church in the wake of the devastations
          caused
          by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Because the church is in the centre of it all (please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me),
          I want to make some suggestions to priests and pastors on how they might approach the future to save their
          ministry and save more lives.</p>

        <p>This article addresses two things. One, this article deals with how to mobilize the church to lead the
          COVID-19
          containment measures, to reduce the rate of infections to the barest minimum or to eliminate it altogether. I
          believe that the church is the most fit to lead this positive change and best organized public institution to
          achieve it. Two, this article also offers suggestions on how to re-invent pastoral ministry and reorganise
          parish or chaplaincy administration for the spiritual and pastoral benefit of the faithful.</p>

        <p>My hunch, as I muted in the other article, is that the change we are seeing is not ephemeral but is likely to
          be deep-seated. It will redefine and reshape pastoral ministry forever. Only those who understand the scale of
          this challenge and can tap into the new opportunities it brings can live into the future and thrive in it. An
          era of empty churches is staring us in the face, self-imposed and government enforced. What should we do? How
          should we face it?</p>

        <p>Let us start with COVID-19 roll-back strategies. The first thing of course is to accept that COVID-19 is real
          and that gathering in the churches, in the ways we are used to, will lead to more infections and ultimately to
          more deaths. The point is that the people are vulnerable and weak. They are likely to believe the priests,
          whether the priest is himself properly informed or not. So, why spread ignorance or understate and obviously
          serious matter. But, if we love our people, why should we expose them to danger and death?</p>

        <p>Once we all accept that this disease is real, the next natural thing to think of is how do we keep the people
          safe when they come to church. It is something positive that almost all churches are observing the external
          precautions of washing hands and using sanitizers. Church services have been broken up and the time for church
          service is now approximately one hour. To a lesser extent some are observing spaced sitting in churches and
          wearing of facemasks. Communion by hand is now mainstream, although it still does not go well with some crop
          of
          arch conservatives.</p>

        <p>In my own opinion, these are not where the real danger lies. The most important move parish priests and
          pastors
          can make is to abide by and strictly enforce short service times. Services should be spaced out adequately.
          Each
          should not be more than one hour, under any circumstance. This of course will reduce the amount of interaction
          and contact-making time, but also give room to re-clean, re-disinfect and even fumigate where possible.
          Microphones should be particularly disinfected because of the millions of droplets of saliva that percolate on
          them, each time moving from person to person.</p>

        <p>To be able to celebrate short Masses, singing must be reduced drastically. The commons of the mass can be
          conveniently recited. Communal singing using hymn books can be re-introduced, but bands and choral (choruses)
          singing should be suspended forthwith and strictly enforced. Whether for thanksgiving, ministration,
          offerings,
          the most dangerous thing about choral singing accompanied or unaccompanied by the band is that they charge the
          church with emotions. Under such charged atmosphere, millions of saliva droplets are released into the air. In
          turn they find their way into our orifices and infect us. This is very dangerous. Halting the spread of the
          virus is the biggest task for the church.</p>

        <p>What happens if the churches get shut a second time? How can priests and pastors earn a living? How can they
          provide pastoral care to their parishioners during lockdowns? This is the second part of this article. Each
          situation might require a special response, but it will be possible to think in general terms. To start with,
          pastors need to understand that it will not be business as usual. It will not be enough to wait for people to
          converge every Sunday or weekdays in churches.</p>

        <p>The first thing to be done would be to migrate online. This will require new skills, new facilities, and
          fresh
          capabilities. Services will have to be streamed online to parishioners in various destinations. Parishes who
          do
          not have it yet, should start thinking of setting up websites or at least social media accounts on Facebook,
          Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube etc. Through these avenues, priests and pastors can maintain regular
          contacts with their flock.</p>

        <p>To power this kind of innovation, more fundamental administrative structures that can support online
          activities
          for parishioners need to be put in place. As it is now, priests and pastors may be conversant with the
          geography
          of their parish but not necessarily its demography. Since active participation on online platforms require
          compiling personal information of parishioners, fair knowledge of the parish population and their composition,
          it is essential that such parish data be built up.</p>

        <p>Armed with such information, priests and pastors can mobilize active participation of parishioners in and out
          of lockdowns. Masses, prayer services, sermons, pastoral guides can be streamed online for the benefit of
          parishioners, just as information on palliatives and material provisions for parishioners can be displayed so
          that everybody can see. By the same token, financial contributions for the upkeep of ministers and for other
          projects in the parish will continue to flow in uninterrupted.</p>

        <p>There is no doubt that only ministers who can drive their pastoral ministry in this direction can fulfil
          their
          mission and win. Successful ministers will have to ensure that the churches they lead does not aid or abet the
          spread of the virus. At the same they should also ensure that the pandemic does not negatively affect pastoral
          ministry. Thank God, technology is here to help us. But only the bold and brave can take advantage of what
          technology offers.</p>

                  We realize that it is not that simple, which is why here we share
